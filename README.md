# LaTent - *A Mathematician's Guide to the Universe*

## Purpose
Everyone remembers their first introduction to LaTeX and it was never pleasant.
From University math courses to making resumes or anything PDF related, LaTeX is 
infamous for its sharp learning curve. This project seeks to remedy the challenges of
memorizing and familiarizing the nature of LaTex commands and is not only geered towards students
but all new users to LaTex. 
<p>
The project will serve both as a simple collection of navigable LaTeX commands and 
as a personal collection of favourite commands/tricks (Much like in Half-Blood Prince).

## User Stories
Features and specific tasks I would like to accomplish as a **user** with this application.

- As a **user**, I want to be able to add/remove/edit my own commands with descriptions to my collection.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to see all the commands I have saved so far in my journal.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to render saved LaTex notation when I am looking through my collection.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to search for specific commands through keywords to see their details.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to choose to save my current collection and its commands.
